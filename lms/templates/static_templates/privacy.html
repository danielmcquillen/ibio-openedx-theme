        <h3>Information Collected with Cookies and What are Cookies?</h3>

        <p>A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a
            site, that site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive
            specifically designated for cookies. Each site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's
            preferences allow it.</p>

        <p>Note that your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to sites and
            online services you visit. There is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means
            in this context. Like many websites and online services, we currently do not alter our practices when we
            receive a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” you may
            wish to visit <a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.com">http://www.allaboutdnt.com.</a></p>
